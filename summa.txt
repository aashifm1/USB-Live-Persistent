Creating your own Linux operating system, similar to Pop!_OS, is an ambitious but exciting project. To break it down, you'll need to approach this task by combining several components, including:

Kernel: The core of the operating system.

Bootloader: The program that loads the operating system into memory.

Filesystem Structure: The way files and directories are organized.

Package Management System: A way to install, update, and remove software.

Desktop Environment: What the user interacts with visually (like GNOME, KDE, or creating your own).

System Tools and Utilities: Basic utilities, daemons, and configuration tools for system management.

Rather than creating everything from scratch, you could customize an existing distribution, such as Ubuntu (since Pop!_OS is based on Ubuntu), or you could start from a barebones distribution like Arch or Debian. Below, I'll outline the key steps and files needed to build your own custom Linux OS.

Step 1: Setting Up a Base Distribution

First, pick a base distribution to build from. This could be:

Ubuntu (used by Pop!_OS) – Easiest to work with if you want something stable and widely supported.

Debian – Similar to Ubuntu but more minimalistic.

Arch Linux – For a very custom, minimal setup (you'll need to do a lot of manual work, but you’ll have total control).

Step 2: Customize the Kernel

Pop!_OS and most Linux distributions use the Linux Kernel (created by Linus Torvalds). You can use the default kernel or create your own.
